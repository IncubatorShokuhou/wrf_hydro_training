    "Some of the errors do not get caught by the workflow and those are the most difficult ones to figure out. Below is a few of the possible failures that could happen: \n",
    "#### Not finding restart files at the end of spin up date. \n",
    "Users specify the start and end date of the spinup period in the `setup.parm` file. The User also specified the frequency of restart files (for both LSM and hydro) in the `setup.parm` file. The workflow looks for the restart file at the end date requested for the spin up as an indication tha the model run is complete. So if the user define the spinup period and the restart frequency in a way that there will not be any restart files outputted at the end of the simulations, python workflow does not see the restart file and will fall into an infite loop. To address, our common practice is to define the periods (both start/end) for spin up, calibration and validation at the start of the month and set the frequency of restart files to -9999 which will output restart files once every month. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fixed Grid ID: \n",
    "Grid ID is hard-coded to 1 in the calibration workflow, meaning it is expecting the restart files to be named like `???DOMAIN1` and if they are not, the model does not see the restart files, and will think that the job has not finished, and restart it. In this case, the workflow will be in an infinite loop and does not finish. If your domain is an NWM cutout, then this problem will not arise. However, if you are using a non NWM domain, make sure the `grid_id` global attribute in the `wrfinput.nc` file is 1. This is where the LSM will grab the index of the domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow needs both restart files:\n",
    "Users cannot turn off all the routings, since the workflow looks for both restart files (LSM and hydro) as an indication of job completion. If user turns off all the routing options, there will not be any hydro restart file, and therefore the model will fall into in infinite loop. "
