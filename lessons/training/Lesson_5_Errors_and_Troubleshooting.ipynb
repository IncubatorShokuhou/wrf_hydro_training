Depending on which one crashes, a LOCK file will be created. If the model crashes, the file will be called `RUN.LOCK` and it will be placed under the `RUN.SPINIP` directory. If the calibration workflow crashes, then a LOCK file called `CALIB.LOCK` will be created and is placed under the `RUN.SPINUP` directory. The workflow will be running in the background but since there is LOCK file, it will not do anything and will hold still till you fix the issue and remove the LOCK file.
