    "Few things could cause error in the SPINUP (covered in Lesson 3). Most of the errors could be caught by the calibration workflow and if the email address is provided in the `setup.parm`  file, then a proper message will be sent out to the user and specifying that there is a problem and user needs to address it. Usually there are two types of errors that could happen at this stage. Depending on which one crashes, a LOCK file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  WRF-Hydro model crashes. If the model crashes, the file will be called `RUN.LOCK` and it will be placed under the `RUN.SPINIP` directory.\n",
    "*  Calibration workflow (R scripts) crashes. If the calibration workflow crashes, then a LOCK file called `CALIB.LOCK` will be created and is placed under the `RUN.SPINUP` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow will be running in the background but since there is LOCK file, it will not do anything and will hold still until you fix the issue and remove the LOCK file. After removing the LOCK file, the procedure will restart and pick up from it crashed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the content of the email looks like?\n",
    "* If WRF-Hydro model fails, it would be a message like: `ERROR: SIMULATION FOR GAGE: 01447720 HAS FAILED A SECOND TIME. PLEASE FIX ISSUE AND MANUALLY REMOVE LOCK FILE: /home/docker/example_case/Calibration/output/example1/01447720/RUN.SPINUP/RUN.LOCK`\n",

These two files are the first place to look for hints of why the model failed. You could also look at the diag files in the same folder, sometimes those files have better info in them. \n",
    "* if the calibration workflow fails, you will see a standart error and out file in the `RUN.SPINUP/OUTPUT` directory which look like this: `/home/docker/example_case/Calibration/output/example1/01447720/RUN.SPINUP/OUTPUT/WH_CALIB_1_1.err and WH_CALIB_1_1.out`. The error information should be found there. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Errors not caught by workflow: \n",
    "Some of the errors do not get caught by the workflow and those are the most difficult ones to figure out. Below is a few of the possible failures that could happen. \n",
    "### Not finding restart files at the end of spin up date. \n",
    "User specify the start and end date of the spip up period in the `setup.parm` file. User also specified the frequency of restart files (for both LSM and hydro) in the `setup.parm` file. The workflow looks for the restart file at the end date requested for the spin up as an indication tha the model run is complete. So if the user define the sin up period and the restart frequency in a way that there will not be any restart files outputted at the end of the simulations, python workflow does not see the restart file and will fall into an infite loop. Our common practice is to define the perios (both start/end) for spin up, calibration and validation at the start of the month and set the frequency of restart files to -9999 which will output restart files once every month. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixed Grid ID: \n",
    "Grid ID is hard-coded to 1 in the calibration workflow, meaning it is expecting the restart files to be named like `???DOMAIN1` and if they are not, the model does not see the resart files, and think that the job has not finished, and restart it. In this case, the workflow will be in an inifite loop and does not finish. If your domain is an NWM cutout, then this problem will not arise. However, if you are using a non NWM domain, make sure the `grid_id` global attribute in the `wrfinput.nc` file is 1. This is where the LSM will grab the index of the domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow needs both restart files:\n",
    "User cannot turn off all the routings, since the workflow look for both restart files (LSM and hydro) as an indication of job completion. If user turns off all the routing options, there will not be any hydro restart file, and therefore the model will fall into in infinite loop. "
