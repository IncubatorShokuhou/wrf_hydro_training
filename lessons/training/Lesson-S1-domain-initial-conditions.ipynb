    "# Lesson S1 - Defining the domain and model initial conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson covers two topics: creating your case-specific domain that will also be used throughout the WRF-Hydro system and defining static and initial conditions used for the land surface model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "**This notebook is not intended to be used interactively and merely is used to create a static markdown document.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson uses the [wrfhydro/wps](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrfhydro/wps) docker utility, which can be obtained using the `command docker pull wrfhydro/wps`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will use several files from the Costa Rica example case provided for this training.\n",
    "\n",
    "All paths used in this lesson assume that the lesson materials are located under your home directory in a folder named wrf-hydro-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data sources\n",
    "WRF-Hydro leverages the extensive domain generation and geophysical dataset processing tools available in the [WRF Preprocessing System (WPS)](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/). The geographical input data (e.g. land cover, soil texture, and terrain height) are some of the primary datasets used by WRF-Hydro. The entire dataset collection can be obtained from the WPS geographical input data [download page](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html). However, these data are rather large (~50GB) and contain a number of datasets that are not used in most implementations of WRF-Hydro. To facilitate the domain generation process, the WRF-Hydro team has created a subset of the data by removing unnecessary data, removing resolutions of the data not commonly used, and limiting the areal extent of this subset. This is consistent with the availability of other datasets used in this tutorial. Thus, the dataset provided with the wrfhydro/wps Docker container is considerably smaller than the complete WRF-WPS dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the geogrid file to define the model domain\n",
    "\n",
    "### The geogrid.exe program\n",
    "The WPS program *geogrid.exe* is used to create the *geo_em_d01.nc* file, hereafter referred to as the 'geogrid' file. The *geogrid.exe* program takes a Fortran namelist (*namelist.wps*) and the [WPS geographical input data](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html) as inputs and creates the geogrid file. However, the *geogrid.exe* program requires that WRF and WPS be built according to your system specification, and building WRF and WPS can be difficult on some systems. Additionally, much of the functionality of WRF and WPS is not utilized for creating a geogrid file for WRF-Hydro, and many of the options in the *namelist.wps* are not relevant to this process. Therefore, we have created a Docker container and Python command line utility to abstract much of the WRF/WPS complexity and simplify the process of creating a geogrid file for WRF-Hydro users. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the steps to create the geogrid file using this method in the section 'Creating the geogrid file'. For more advanced usage please see the WPS documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining domain boundaries\n",
    "The land surface model in WRF-Hydro operates on the domain defined within the geogrid file. The geogrid.exe program generates this file based upon input variables specified in the *namelist.wps* file. The first step to creating the geogrid file is to define our domain boundaries. The *geogrid.exe* program takes a centerpoint, x and y grid specifications, and other projection information to define a bounding box for the domain. If you do not already have coordinates, you can obtain them from Google Earth or a standard GIS system. However, for this tutorial we have supplied the coordinates for you and you may use the WRF-Hydro geogrid python command line utility to visualize the domain location and create the geogrid file given these coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring the WPS geogrid.exe utility and namelist.wps\n",
    "The WPS *geogrid.exe* utility is controlled by options set in the *namelist.wps*. As previously stated, there are many options in the *namelist.wps* file that are not relevant to most WRF-Hydro users. For educational purposes, we will take a quick look at a full *namelist.wps* file and then discuss the relevant options used by the WRF-Hydro geogrid utility wrapper in more detail.\n"

    "| dx | A real value specifying the grid distance in the x-direction where the map scale factor is 1. The grid distance is in meters for the 'polar', 'lambert', and 'mercator' projection, and in degrees longitude for the 'lat-lon' projection. |\n",
    "| dy | A real value specifying the grid distance in the y-direction where the map scale factor is 1. The grid distance is in meters for the 'polar', 'lambert', and 'mercator' projection, and in degrees latitude for the 'lat-lon' projection. |\n",
    "| map_proj | A character string specifying the projection of the simulation domain. Accepted projections are 'lambert', 'polar', 'mercator', and 'lat-lon'. Default value is 'lambert'. |\n",

    "| truelat2 | A real value specifying, the second true latitude for the Lambert conformal conic projection. For all other projections, truelat2 is ignored. No default value. |\n",
    "| stand_lon | A real value specifying, the longitude that is parallel with the y-axis in the Lambert conformal and polar stereographic projections. For the regular latitude-longitude projection, this value gives the rotation about the earth's geographic poles. No default value. |\n",
    "| geog_data_res | A character string specifying a corresponding resolution or list of resolutions separated by + symbols of source data to be used when interpolating static terrestrial data to the grid. This string should contain a resolution matching a string preceding a colon in a rel_path or abs_path specification (see the description of GEOGRID.TBL options) in the GEOGRID.TBL file for each field. If a resolution in the string does not match any such string in a rel_path or abs_path specification for a field in GEOGRID.TBL, a default resolution of data for that field, if one is specified, will be used. If multiple resolutions match, the first resolution to match a string in a rel_path or abs_path specification in the GEOGRID.TBL file will be used. Default value is 'default'. |\n",
    "| geog_data_path | A character string giving the path, either relative or absolute, to the directory where the geographical data directories may be found. This path is the one to which rel_path specifications in the GEOGRID.TBL file are given in relation to. No default value. |\n",
