    "|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "|**BEXP** | dimensionless| Yes | Yes | Yes | *Pore size distribution index*: BEXP controls the shape of the soil water retention curve, and therefore how slowly/quickly water will move through the soil column. It can have any positive values where small values indicate the medium having a wide range of pore sizes and high values indicating more uniform pore size distribution. Higher values of the BEXP will result in higher effective saturation values and consequently higher relative hydraulic conductivity. With higher BEXP values, the water will move faster and one would observe higher peak values in the hydrographs and lower baseflow values at interevents. |\n",
    "|**SMCMAX** | volumetric fraction| Yes | Yes | Yes | *Saturation soil moisture content (i.e., porosity)*|\n",
    "|**DKSAT** |m/s | Yes | Yes | Yes | *Saturated hydraulic conductivity*:As with most physically-based hydrological models, the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (DKSAT) controls the speed at which water moves through the subsurface. This is a sensitive parameter in the model, and while easy to measure at the point scale, DKSAT is tricky to estimate at the scale of kilometers. Initial values are estimated based on soil texture class, but reported ranges have large (many orders of magnitude) variability.|\n",
    "|**RSURFEXP** | dimensionless| No | Yes | Yes | *Exponent in the resistance equation for soil evaporation*: RSURFEXP controls the shape for the resistance curve as it relates to soil moisture, higher RSURFEXP will result in larger resistance for a given soil moisture and hence less soil evaporation.|\n",
    "|**REFKDT** | unitless| No | Yes | No | *Surface runoff parameter*: REFKDT is a surface runoff parameter that controls how easily precipitation reaching the surface infiltrates into the soil column versus staying on the surface where it can become surface runoff. Higher values of REFKDT lead to more infiltration and less surface (fast) runoff. This tunable parameter can be set to a relatively high value (e.g., 3.0) suitable for running the column land surface model only. When activating terrain routing to explicitly model these processes, we often reduce this parameter. It should be also noted that this parameter is time step dependent and in the case of finer LSM timestep you may want to reduce this parameter to compensate for the more frequent calls to the vertical infiltration scheme.|\n",
    "|**SLOPE** |unitless | No | Yes | Yes | *Linear scaling of \"openness\" of bottom drainage boundary*: This is another important parameter that affects water partitioning in Noah/NoahMP. Originally estimated based on land surface topography (hence the name SLOPE), the SLOPE parameter actually controls how open or closed the bottom boundary of the soil column is. Values range from 0 to 1, where 0 is a completely closed bottom boundary and 1 is completely open. Lower SLOPE values will keep more water in the soil column, while higher values will allow more water to drain to the channel or to deeper baseflow stores, depending on the selected baseflow physics options.|\n",
    "|**RETDEPRTFAC** | unitless | No | Yes | Yes | *Multiplier on retention depth limit*: Ponded water on the surface above this retention depth threshold can be moved around the landscape via overland flow. Maximum retention depth is variable by terrain slope where higher slopes have lower maximum retention depth, while flat areas have higher initial values. The default value in the NWM code is quite small (~0.001mm), however, in many regions landscape features like wetlands, small detention ponds, and heavy vegetation litter/debris can trap water on the land surface. Increasing the RETDEPRTFAC multiplier will hold more ponded water on the surface before it becomes runoff.|\n",
    "|**LKSATFAC** |unitless | No | Yes | Yes | *Multiplier on lateral hydraulic conductivity (controls anisotropy between vertical and lateral conductivity)*: By default, lateral conductivity matches vertical conductivity. However, in the real world we frequently see many orders of magnitude higher conductivities in the lateral direction vs. the vertical direction (due to soil stratigraphy, preferential flow paths caused by roots and animals, etc.). LKSATFAC is a parameter to adjust the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity and account for this anisotropy.\n",

    "|**LOSS** | unitless | No | No (used in Hi) | Testing | |\n",
    "|**CWPVT** | 1/m | Yes | Yes | Yes | *Canopy wind parameter for canopy wind profile formulation*: It is a canopy wind parameter absorption/attenuation which helps to remove saturated air from the canopy. Higher value meaning more wind attenuation from the canopy, which reduces the transpiration. Higher CWPVT values also reduce snow sublimation which result in more snow in the pack and increasing SWE as well as pushing the melt season slightly further back in the season. |\n",
    "|**VCMX25** | unol/m2/s | Yes | Yes | Yes | Maximum carboxylation at 25C|\n",
    "|**MP** | unitless | Yes | Yes | Yes | *Slope of Ball-Berry conductance relationship*: larger values of mp indicates the leaf consumes more water to produce the same carbon mass and therefore will have greater transpiration|\n",
    "|**MFSNO** | dimensionless | Yes | Yes | Yes | *Melt factor for snow depletion curve* (relationship between the snow covered fraction and snow depth) in the melting season. Increasing MFSNO yields a smaller snow cover fraction for the same snow height, reduces SWE in the snowpack and moves the timing of snowmelt forward in time. Therefore, the streamflow peaks are earlier in time and lower for larger values of MFSNO.|\n",

    "### Sensitivity Analysis: \n",
    "It is highly encouraged to perform a sensitivity analysis over your region of interest to help determine which parameters have significant impact on hydrologic response. A limited sensitivity study was performed on a subset of the above parameters in which the sensitivity was measured with respect to change in the streamflow error metrics such as bias and correlation coefficient as a result of parameter change. It showed that BEXP, SMCMAX, DKSAT and MP are the most sensitive parameters when the sensitivity is measured based on streamflow biases. In addition to this list, ZMAX, EXPON, SLOPE, and REFKDT also become sensitive parameters when looking at the error metrics such as correlation coefficient where the timing of the flow is of importance. There was also another sensitivity anlsysis study focused on the snow parameters where it was shown CWPVT, MFSNO, TAU0, SNOWRERFAC, RSURFSNOW, SCAMAX and SSI are the most sensitive parameters among the snow related parameters. \n",

    "### Absolute value versus multipliers: \n",
    "Some of these parameters are a function of vegetation type (CWPVT, VCMX25, MP) or soil type (BEXP, SMCMAX, DKSAT), and therefore we use a multiplier number in calibration to preserve the spatial pattern of those parameters. MFSNO is also formulated as a multiplier in the calibration code, since in the earlier NWM version. The rest of the parameters are substitute values and will overwrite the default values. \n",

    "### Full Routing versus Long Range configuration: \n",
    "It should be noted that the RETDEPRTFAC and LKSATFAC parameters are only active in full physics and it is not used and calibrated in the long range configuration since the terrain routing is inactive."
