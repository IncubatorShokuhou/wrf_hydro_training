    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this training, we aim to walk you through a hands-on calibration experiment with the Poconos watershed. Specifically, we will be calibrating the basin using observed and modeled streamflow at two USGS locations over a few months in 2011 and validate ove the remaining period in 2011. This is just for demonstration purposes and not the common practice on NWM calibration. In fact, the calibration of the NWM is done using a 5-year period in order to cover different climate regimes in the calibration period. Details of domains, calibration experiments for this exercise will be provided in this and the upcoming lessons. \n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration procedure relies on a python library named PyWrfHydroCalib, which explicitly handles the setup, model tuning, and provides diagnostics supporting the calibration process. This lesson is intended to provide an overview of few key definitions, system requirements, and orienting you through the calibration material provided to you. We will describe the calibration procedure and steps fundementals in Lesson 1 and follow up with hands-on experiment in Lesson 3 and 4 where we will setup, calibrate and validate a small domain."

    "## What Is It? Defining Key Terms:\n",
    "### WRF-Hydro: \n",
    "An open-source community model, is used for a range of projects, including flash flood prediction, regional hydroclimate impacts assessment, seasonal forecasting of water resources, and land-atmosphere coupling studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The National Water Model (NWM):\n",
    "A joint development effort between the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the National Weather Service (NWS) Office of Water Prediction (OWP). The NWM is a set of operational analysis and forecast configurations of the WRF-Hydro modeling system (Gochis et al., 2013) which runs over the entire continental United States (https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm) as well as Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Alaska will also become operational in NWMv30. \n",
    "\n",
    "### PyWrfHydroCalib:\n",
    "A robust workflow for calibrating parameters over individual basins with a focus on automating the process for hundreds of forecast points in the NWM domain. Here, we describe the various steps involved in setting up a WRF-Hydro calibration experiment, along with how to execute the calibration workflow and access the various results from it. This version of the calibration workflow is the RnD branch of the NWMv30 calibration and it not yet finalized and official. There are still developments and code improvement underway and it will be finalized before our official NWMV30 onborading, which is scheduled for Jan 2022. "

    "## PyWrfHydroCalib System Requirements\n",
    "Calibration goes beyond setting up the NWM or WRF-Hydro for a model simulation. Some understanding of the preparation of datasets, hydrologic parameters, and their associated impact on model states is needed. You will decide which parameters to calibrate, along with the proper ranges, and the length of the calibration simulation/evaluation period. It is highly encouraged that you run sensitivity analysis for the modeling domain to explore which parameters have significant impact on the modeled states being calibrated. \n",

    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "#### Python Packages:\n",
    "To run the calibration workflow, there are multiple software requirements and pre-processing steps that need to take place prior to actual calibration. Currently, the calibration workflow relies on a set of Python and R libraries to execute various functions and plotting capabilities. This is in addition to existing requirements to compile and run WRF-Hydro/NWM. As of early 2019, the calibration workflow code has been migrated from Python 2 to Python 3. The following Python libraries are used by the workflow:\n",
